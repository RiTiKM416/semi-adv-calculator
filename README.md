Simple Calculator in C++
This project is a simple calculator program implemented in C++. The program allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two integer values.

Features
User Input: Users can input two integer values to perform arithmetic operations.
Arithmetic Operations: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Error Handling: Provides error messages for invalid user inputs.
Clear Screen: Clears the screen after each operation for better user experience.
Usage
To use the calculator:

Compile the code using a C++ compiler.
Run the executable.
Follow the on-screen instructions to input two integer values and select an arithmetic operation.
Code Structure
The project consists of two main parts:

Main Code (main.cpp):

Contains the main logic of the calculator program.
Handles user input, arithmetic operations, and error handling.
Header File (Header.h):

Contains function declarations for the calculator operations.
Includes necessary libraries and defines function prototypes.
How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Compile the main.cpp file using a C++ compiler.
Run the compiled executable to use the calculator.
